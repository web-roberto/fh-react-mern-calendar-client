# Backend MERN - Calendar - Roberto

1º we create the BDD in Atlas
2º I copy the connection chain to my local node server (we take off after .net/ and we add a name to the dataBase) and I start my server.
3ª I start my local client and I register a new user and new events and we check it in Atlas
4º we put the .env fold in .gitignore, we deploy to Heroku my server and we assign there the environment variables.
5º We copy the server address published in Heroku and we paste this address to the client. We check that everything goes right.
5ª We do to client 'yarn build' and we copy 'assets' and 'index.html' to the 'public' folder of the server.
   That way, the client and the serve run in the same place.
6ª we add the 'server' address in Heroku to my portoliocv

Despoyed the server and client sides in Heroku:'fh-mern-calendar-backend'.
